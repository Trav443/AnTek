    <pre id="Main">Here are some heros we look up to!:

Aaron Swartz:
Some of you may know Aaron Swartz as one of the founder of reddit, 
and having suddenly committed suicide, leading up to his death he was doing a lot of activism for freedom of information and free internet, 
one of these projects he downloaded hundreds of thousands to millions of academic papers from JSTOR, 
a site dedicated to gatekeeping academic research for only those who can afford it. 
What he did caught the attention of the feds, because the state also made lots of money off of sites like JSTOR, 
so they threw the book at aaron, 35 years in prison and 1M dollar fine. 
On January 11th, 2013, Aaron Committed suicide. Obviously this is a very generalized description, I recommend you research him and his story, 
there is a great documentary called "The Internets Own Boy".

Jeremy Hammond:
Jeremy Hammond is most recognized for creating "HackThisSite", 
a site for learning about hacking with hands on examples. Jeremy is also a militant anarchist and a extremely skilled hacktivist. 
In the early 2010s Jeremy hacked into the Private intelligence firm Stratfor for which he was arrested and kept in prison for roughly a decade. Now that he is out, 
he seems to not have been scared off from being outspoken about his beliefs, although he is banned from technology for a while, 
Im fairly confident he will find ways to get his message out there.

Phineas Fisher:
Phineas Fisher has done many notable things, but essentially they are a hacktivist and self proclaimed anarchist revolutionary, 
who has hacked everything from Hacking Team, an organization who has made spyware for oppressive regimes, to corrupt police departments, to Turkeys ruling (and oppressive) party, 
as well as many more. They have showed their skill level through writeups they create after every hack as well as a manifesto on how to hack, which is focused on activism.

Ross Ulbricht:
Im sure many of you are well aware of Ross's work, he is believed to be the creator of the Silk Road, 
the first well known darknet  market place. Ross was inspired by the works of Ludwig Von Mises in college and focused his life towards that of philosophical growth and change. 
He made the Silk Road as a free market that subverted the State, with limited rules, but he did say that you couldn’t sell anything that infringed on others rights. 
Despite what the mainstream painted him out to be, his cause was noble and his punishment was unjust (2 life sentences).

Edward Snowden:
Im sure you have heard his name, but for those who dont know, Edward Snowden was a NSA subcontractor, 
who disclosed a plethora of mass surveillance programs ran mostly by the NSA and FiveEye organizations, 
with help from telecom companies and EU countries. His revelations prompted him to go into hiding, he now resides in Russia outside US jurisdiction.
 Among his disclosures were programs like XKeyScore and PRISM, which are both huge invasions of privacy.

Julian Assange:
As the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian was crucial in the release of hundreds of whistleblows within the 21st century. 
While some may judge his character, his work with WikiLeaks has been vital to Government transparency and 
revealing things that the population has the right to know.

David Chaum:
David Chaum is not as well known, but still a very important piece to modern day privacy. 
He is regarded as the inventor of digital currency and blockchain technology.
